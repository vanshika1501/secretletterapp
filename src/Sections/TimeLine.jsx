This AI-driven chat interface cut manual errors by 95% and sped up experiment setup by 90%, greatly improving workflow automation and data access. I also implemented NLP automation in Ask AI for lab data analysis, which boosted workflow efficiency by 40%. Furthermore, I designed Scispotâ€™s Knowledge Graph using React.js, Neo4j, D3.js, LLMs, and REST APIs, leading to a 70% improvement in search efficiency. To enhance the user experience, I also built and deployed a React dashboard, optimizing the frontend for both web and iPad interfaces.",
